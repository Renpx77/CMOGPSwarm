The design of most existing genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) for swarm patterns generation depends on designersâ€™ prior knowledge. Therefore, it is <br>
usually a trial-and-error process to enable GRN models to adapt to complex and dynamic environments. In this work, we proposed a design automation platform  <br>
for swarm robots entrapping patterns written by Python and MATLAB, which automatically designs a genetic regulatory network model for dynamic generation of  <br>
swarm robots entrapping patterns. Finally, comparative experiments demonstrate that the platform can obtain novel GRNs that have simpler structures than those  <br>
designed by human experts, but achieve better performances in complex and dynamic environments.
