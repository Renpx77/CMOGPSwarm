The design of most existing genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) for swarm patterns generation depends on designersâ€™ prior knowledge. Therefore, it is 
usually a trial-and-error process to enable GRN models to adapt to complex and dynamic environments. In this work, we proposed a design automation platform 
for swarm robots entrapping patterns written by Python and MATLAB, which automatically designs a genetic regulatory network model for dynamic generation of 
swarm robots entrapping patterns. Finally, comparative experiments demonstrate that the platform can obtain novel GRNs that have simpler structures than those
designed by human experts, but achieve better performances in complex and dynamic environments.
